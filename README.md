# Investment-Value-Calculation
# Compound Interest Calculator (Recursive Version)

## Overview

This C program calculates the compound interest on an investment using recursion. The program prompts the user for the principal amount, annual interest rate, and the number of years for the investment. The compound interest is applied recursively year by year.

## Features

- Uses recursion to calculate compound interest year by year.
- Prompts the user for the principal amount, interest rate, and number of years.
- Validates the user input to ensure that it is positive and in the correct format.
- Converts the interest rate from percentage to decimal for calculation.
- Outputs the final amount after applying compound interest for the specified number of years.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
- Basic understanding of C programming and recursion.
